Pod2VMSHlp - a pod to VMS Help format converter

=head1 INSTALLATION

Follow the usual 4 line mantra after building and 
installing perl, that is:

    perl Makefile.PL
    mms
    perl [.t]script.t   ! rather than "mms test"
    mms install

Note that with Perl 5.005_02 "mms test" may not work with this
module for unknown reasons.  You should however, expect to obtain:

    perl [.t]script.t
    1..4
    ok 1
    ok 2
    ok 3
    ok 4

If you see message(s) about a missing Test or Test::Harness module then
try running:

    perl [.t]script.s

where the result should be as for script.t above and any other 
result is cause for alarm :-)

By the way, this is a simple (i.e. non XS based) module 
that can still be installed "by hand" if you have neither 
MMS (from DECSet) nor MMK (free from MadGoat) installed.
Just be sure to copy [.Pod]Hlp.pm right into

   perl_root:[lib.pod]Hlp.pm

You might also want to COPY the pod2hlp. program into:

   perl_root:[lib.pod]pod2hlp.

And run that script from there (more information is 
in the L<SAMPLE SCRIPTS> section below).

=head1 DOCUMENTATION

Is available in pod in the Pod::Hlp package.  Type:

    perldoc Pod::Hlp 

for more, or convert it to .HLP, stick it in a .HLB and
type HELP POD HLP for more information.

=head1 SAMPLE SCRIPTS

Included with the Pod2VMSHlp package are two scripts that 
will help you to turn files containing pod into VMS HLP 
files and/or HLB libraries:

=over 4

=item * pod2hlp

Usage is: C<perl pod2hlp. filename.pod n> where C<n> is the level
that you want filename.hlp to be, e.g. the default is '1' so that:

     filename.pod           1 filename
     =head1 Foo             2 Foo
     =head2 Bar             3 Bar

but this could be overridden with:

     perl pod2hlp. filename.pod 3

to obtain:

     filename.pod           3 filename
     =head1 Foo             4 Foo
     =head2 Bar             5 Bar

Warning: The help librarian has strict requirements on the
order of section headings.  Hence pod2hlp may map some 
C<=head1> and C<=head2>'s differently depending on whether 
they are (or follow) frequently seen headers like "NAME", 
"AUTHOR", I<etc>.  The basic rule is don't put a C<=head2>
at the start of a pod file, try a C<=head1> instead.
Also try to avoid C<=headN> for N >= 3.  This latter is 
a pod rule (see L<perlpod>) that is enforced by Pod::Hlp.

=item * pod2hlb

Usage is: C<perl pod2hlb.> this will take all the F<perl*.pod> files
in F<perl_root:[lib.pod]> and turn them into F<perl*.hlp> files (at help
levels 1,2,3) and create a new help library F<PERL.HLB> all in the DEFAULT
directory.  This script uses DCLs LIBRARY/HELP librarian.
